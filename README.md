## What Is This

Nous is an autonomous AI coding agent — like Claude Code or Cursor — but it runs **entirely on your local hardware** via Ollama. No cloud. No API keys. No telemetry. No data leaving your machine. It is built as a concurrent cognitive architecture: six independent processing streams (perceive, reason, plan, execute, reflect, learn) communicate through a shared blackboard, producing emergent intelligent behavior from the interplay of simple, well-defined modules. The result is a self-contained ~8 MB Go binary that can read your codebase, reason about it, write files, execute commands, and learn from its own experience — all running on CPU with whatever model you point it at.

```

All six streams run as independent goroutines. They do not call each other — they communicate exclusively through the blackboard. This means the system can perceive new input while simultaneously executing a plan step, reflecting on a previous result, and learning from a completed goal.

## Configuration

All configuration is via CLI flags. No config files, no environment variables, no hidden state.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--model` | `qwen2.5:1.5b` | Ollama model to use |
| `--host` | `http://localhost:11434` | Ollama server address |
| `--memory` | `~/.nous` | Path for persistent memory and session storage |
| `--allow-shell` | `false` | Enable shell command execution |
| `--trust` | `false` | Skip confirmation prompts for file and shell operations |
| `--resume` | (none) | Resume a previous session by ID |
| `--version` | — | Print version and exit |

---

## Tools

Nous ships with 18 built-in tools that the reasoning engine can invoke autonomously. The model decides which tools to call and in what order — chaining multiple calls in a loop until it has enough information to answer.

| Tool | Description | Requires `--allow-shell` |
|---|---|---|
| `read` | Read file contents with optional line offset and limit | No |
| `write` | Create or overwrite a file (supports undo) | No (prompts for confirmation) |
| `edit` | Replace a specific string in a file (exact match, must be unique, supports undo) | No (prompts for confirmation) |
| `glob` | Find files matching a glob pattern (e.g. `*.go`) | No |
| `grep` | Search file contents for a regex pattern with optional file filter | No |
| `ls` | List directory contents with file sizes | No |
| `tree` | Show project directory structure with configurable depth | No |
| `mkdir` | Create a directory and all parent directories (supports undo) | No (prompts for confirmation) |
| `shell` | Execute an arbitrary shell command | **Yes** |
| `fetch` | HTTP GET with HTML tag stripping (1MB limit) | No |
| `run` | Execute a command with stdin support and 60s timeout | **Yes** |
| `sysinfo` | Show OS, architecture, CPU, disk space | No |
| `clipboard` | Read from or write to the system clipboard (via xclip/xsel) | No |
| `find_replace` | Regex find-and-replace in a file (supports undo) | No (prompts for confirmation) |
| `git` | Run git commands (status, diff, log, add, commit, etc.) | No |
| `patch` | Multi-line before/after text replacement | No (prompts for confirmation) |
| `replace_all` | Replace all occurrences of a string across multiple files | No (prompts for confirmation) |
| `diff` | Show git diff (working directory or staged) | No |

Destructive tools (`write`, `edit`, `shell`, `mkdir`, `patch`, `replace_all`, `find_replace`) require explicit user confirmation unless `--trust` is set. File modifications are tracked on an undo stack — use `/undo` to revert.

---

## Slash Commands

|---|---|
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/status` | Show cognitive system status (percepts, goals, memory, conversation) |
| `/memory` | Show working memory contents ranked by relevance |
| `/longterm` | Show long-term memory entries with access counts |
| `/remember <key> <value>` | Store a project fact (persists across sessions) |
| `/recall <query>` | Search project memory by keyword |
| `/forget <key>` | Remove a project fact |
| `/undo` | Revert the last file change |
| `/history` | Show the undo stack |
| `/goals` | Show active goals and their status |
| `/model` | Show current model info and list all available Ollama models |
| `/tools` | List all registered tools with descriptions |
| `/project` | Show detected project info (language, file count, key files, tree) |
| `/sessions` | List all saved sessions with message counts |
| `/save [name]` | Save the current session with an optional name |
| `/clear` | Clear conversation context |
| `/quit` | Save session and exit |

## How the Cognitive Architecture Works

Classical AI agents make a single LLM call per user message. Nous works differently.

**Six concurrent streams** run as goroutines, communicating through a shared **blackboard** — a thread-safe cognitive workspace that holds percepts, goals, plans, action records, and working memory. No stream calls another directly. They react to events:

1. **Perceiver** — Listens for raw user input. Extracts intent and entities via the LLM. Posts a structured `Percept` to the blackboard.

2. **Reasoner** — Reacts to percepts. Runs autonomous chain-of-thought inference with tool use. Chains up to 8 tool calls in a single loop — reading files, searching code, editing files — before producing a final answer. Streams tokens to the terminal in real time, suppressing tool-call JSON from the display. Protected by the **Cognitive Grounding** system (see below).

3. **Planner** — Reacts to new goals. Decomposes them into ordered, executable step sequences using hierarchical task decomposition via the LLM.

4. **Executor** — Reacts to plans. Walks through each step, runs the specified tool, and records success or failure as an `ActionRecord` on the blackboard.

5. **Reflector** — Reacts to action records. Evaluates output quality via the LLM. If an action failed or produced questionable results, flags it for re-planning.

6. **Learner** — Reacts to completed goals. Extracts behavioral patterns from successful interactions and persists them to disk as JSON. Over time, the system builds a library of proven strategies.

**Memory is triple-layered:**

- **Working Memory** — Capacity-limited (64 slots), decay-based. Items lose relevance over time and are evicted when capacity is exceeded. Accessing an item boosts its relevance (recency effect).
- **Long-Term Memory** — Persistent JSON-backed key-value store with access counting. Survives restarts. Categories enable structured retrieval.
- **Project Memory** — Per-project fact store (`.nous/project_memory.json`). Stores conventions, architecture decisions, and key patterns. Accessible via `/remember`, `/recall`, `/forget`.

**Undo Stack** — All file-modifying tools (write, edit, find_replace, mkdir) push entries onto an undo stack. Use `/undo` to revert the most recent change, `/history` to view the stack.

**Context Compression** — The `compress` module distills conversation fragments into dense "atoms" — reusable `{trigger, knowledge, weight}` tuples. Automatically triggered when context budget exceeds 75%.

**Cognitive Grounding** (v0.5.0) — A five-layer system that prevents hallucinations in small models:

1. **Progressive Tool Disclosure** — Instead of injecting all 18 tools into the system prompt (~1000 tokens), only the 5-8 tools relevant to the detected intent are shown. The model can request additional tool categories via a `request_tools` meta-tool. Saves ~500 tokens of context.

2. **Smart Result Truncation** — Tool-specific truncation keeps results compact: file reads show first/last 20 lines, grep/glob cap at 15 matches, directory listings cap at 30 entries. Universal 2048-char hard limit.

3. **Result Validation** — Every tool result is checked for common issues (empty reads, missing files, permission errors) and annotated with corrective hints for the model.

4. **Context Budget Tracking** — Estimates token consumption across all messages. Auto-compresses old conversation turns at 75% usage (via atoms or rule-based fallback). Forces a final answer at 85% to prevent context overflow.

5. **Synchronous Reflection Gate** — After each tool call, a rule-based validator checks for: errors, empty results, repeated calls, and excessive iterations. Injects corrective hints and forces the model to answer when it's stuck in a loop.

## Recommended Models

Nous works with any model available through Ollama. Smaller models are faster but less capable at complex reasoning and tool use. Larger models produce better results but need more RAM.

| Model | Parameters | RAM | Speed | Tool Use | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `qwen2.5:1.5b` | 1.5B | ~2 GB | Fast | Decent | Quick tasks, light hardware (default) |
| `qwen2.5-coder:7b` | 7B | ~5 GB | Moderate | Good | Code generation and analysis |
| `codellama:7b` | 7B | ~5 GB | Moderate | Good | Code-focused tasks |
| `llama3.1:8b` | 8B | ~6 GB | Moderate | Good | General-purpose reasoning |
| `deepseek-coder-v2:16b` | 16B | ~12 GB | Slower | Strong | Complex multi-step work |
| `codestral:22b` | 22B | ~14 GB | Slower | Strong | Advanced code understanding |
| `qwen2.5:32b` | 32B | ~20 GB | Slow | Strong | When quality matters most |

Pull a model before first use:

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5:1.5b
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. The architecture is designed for extension without touching the core:

- **New tools** — Implement `func(args map[string]string) (string, error)` and register it in `internal/tools/builtin.go`. The reasoner discovers new tools automatically via the registry.
- **New cognitive streams** — Implement the `Stream` interface (`Name() string`, `Run(ctx context.Context) error`), subscribe to blackboard events, and add it to the stream list in `main.go`.
- **Bug fixes and improvements** — Standard PR workflow. Keep changes focused. Run `make test` and `make lint` before submitting.

The codebase has zero external Go dependencies. Let's keep it that way.
